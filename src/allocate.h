* Simple allocator for data that doesn't get partially free'd.
* The tokenizer and parser allocate a _lot_ of small data structures
* (often just two-three bytes for things like small integers),
* and since they all depend on each other you can't free them
* individually _anyway_. So do something that is very space-
* efficient: allocate larger "blobs", and give out individual
* small bits and pieces of it with no maintenance overhead.
